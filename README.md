# RandomTeleport---Test-Plugin
Test plugin written in Java for Paper with API 1.17. The plugin was tested on version 1.20.4.  -- Description -- The plugin teleports the player to a random location. If the chunk does not load: the player will not be teleported. The plugin is pretty good, but the config could have been added. I don't plan to make any future releases.
